I was always out fishing with Dad. I loved it. You couldn't get me back home for dinner, it was easier and much more fun to cook the catch on the beach. There was nothing like taking off in our little tinnie to go exploring. Then we'd start pestering Dad about going up a notch, getting a better boat. Learn to fix this one first he'd say. Take care of it, do it up right, if you can learn how to get that bit to sit comfy there, then… then you'll know what you really want when you've got some money together. Yeah, all that. And I guess you can say that's why I build boats now.
