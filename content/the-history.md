Using our Water Jet Cutting Service we can cut almost any material into virtually any shape and size.

Water Jet cutting is versatile and able to cut a variety of materials from 6" thick Stainless Steel to Glass, Marble, Rubber, Plastic and Wood to name a few.

Cut accurately with none of the damage or mess caused by hot cutting.

We can cut to size any two dimensional shape using a simple CAD or DXF file.
